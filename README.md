# Awesomewm Wiki Dump

> Convert the old shuttered awesomewm wiki to markdown

# Background

The old AwesomeWM wiki is gone, taken down with other legacy awesomewm infrastructure in [awesome-www#7](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome-www/issues/7).

This archive has an xml dump, and a markdown conversion of that dump. It was introduced in [this comment](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome-www/issues/7#issuecomment-244820814).

It was made with the [mediawiki-to-markdown](https://github.com/philipashlock/mediawiki-to-markdown) converter.
