This is ased on something similar for Ion3 (by Jari Eskelinen).

It shows the current charge of the battery and the time remaining until the battery is full or empty. If the system is on AC the prefix is 'AC', otherwise it's 'Battery'.

It doesn't do any error checking, so I don't even know what can happen if your system isn't exactly like mine. Use at your own risk, yada, yada, yada.
