Amazing is a widget engine written in ruby designed for awesome.

Amazing is not complete at this point, but is much more lightweight than conky, and doesn't require modifying source code to make work properly.

One important thing to know is that in awesome 2.2 the way that the data is updated using awesome-client is different than that of post-2.2. In post-2.2, you must specify the data type, and in 2.2, this isn't needed. More information about this issue [here](http://github.com/dag/amazing/wikis/beyond-awesome-2-2).

Amazing can be downloaded from [Dag/Donri's github](http://github.com/dag/amazing/tree/master). Additionally, there are instructions there on how to [configure and use](http://github.com/dag/amazing/wikis/configuration) amazing.

Some additional widgets [are available](http://sharpe.no-ip.org/downloads/temp/amazing) and written by emsi.
